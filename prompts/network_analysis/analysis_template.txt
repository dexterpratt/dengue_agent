Network Analysis Guidelines

Extract the following information from the network for hypothesis generation:

1. Basic Network Statistics:
   - Node count
   - Edge count
   - Average node degree
   - Type distribution

2. Source Node Identification:
   - Source node name and ID (viral protein)
   - Source node type and properties

3. Propagation Results:
   - Top 10-15 nodes by propagation weight
   - For each node:
     - Name/Gene Symbol
     - Propagation weight
     - Node type
     - Relevant experimental data

4. Experimental Data Properties:
   - Identify all numeric properties that might represent experimental data
   - Group properties by type (expression, phosphorylation, etc.)
   - Summarize range and distribution of values

5. Pathway Enrichment:
   - Identify potential biological pathways represented
   - Group nodes by functional categories if possible

This information should be structured to facilitate hypothesis generation about how the viral protein interacts with host proteins and affects cellular processes.
