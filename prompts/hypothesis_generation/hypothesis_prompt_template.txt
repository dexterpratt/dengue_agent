Based on a dengue virus network analysis for {viral_protein}, I need to generate {n_hypotheses} formal scientific hypotheses.

The dataset includes the following experimental data properties for nodes: {experimental_properties}

The propagation analysis identified the following top nodes with the highest propagation weights (most closely connected to the source node), along with their experimental data:

{nodes_text}

For each hypothesis, please:
1. Propose a specific testable hypothesis about how {viral_protein} might interact with these nodes
2. Focus on relationships supported by the experimental data shown above
3. Format as formal null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses
4. Explain the biological rationale based on the nodes and experimental data involved
5. Suggest specific experiments that could falsify the hypothesis

Format each hypothesis as a JSON object with the following fields:
- "title": A brief descriptive title for the hypothesis (5-10 words)
- "null_hypothesis": The formal null hypothesis statement (H0)
- "alternative_hypothesis": The formal alternative hypothesis statement (H1)
- "rationale": Reasoning behind the hypothesis, referencing the experimental data (3-5 sentences)
- "entities_involved": List of key entities mentioned in the hypothesis
- "experimental_data_used": Brief description of which experimental data properties influenced this hypothesis
- "experimental_validation": 2-3 specific experiments that could falsify the hypothesis
- "confidence": A value from 1-5 indicating your confidence in this hypothesis (5 being highest)

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of hypothesis objects. Do not include any explanation or other text outside the JSON.
