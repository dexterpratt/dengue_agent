# Random Walk with Restart Algorithm Fix

## Problem Identified

After reviewing the code in `tools/algorithms/propagation.py`, I identified a critical issue in the implementation of the random walk with restart algorithm:

1. When the algorithm encountered a node with no neighbors (a dead end), it would immediately terminate with a `"dead_end"` status instead of performing a restart.

2. The restart logic had a condition that prevented restarting to the same seed node: `if current_node != next_seed:`. This is problematic in single-seed scenarios (like most viral protein propagations) because if there's only one seed, the condition often fails and no actual restart occurs.

These issues led to limited exploration of the network, with most propagations terminating prematurely after only a few steps when they hit dead ends.

## Fix Implemented

I've implemented the following changes to address these issues:

1. **Forced Restarts for Dead Ends**: Instead of terminating when a node has no neighbors, the algorithm now forces a restart to one of the seed nodes.

2. **Removed Restart Restriction**: Removed the condition that prevented restarting to the same seed node, allowing proper restarts even in single-seed scenarios.

3. **Added Tracking**: Added a `forced_restart_count` to track how often restarts are triggered by dead ends, providing better diagnostics.

## Test Results

I created a test script (`test_propagation_fix.py`) that runs the algorithm with different parameter combinations on each viral protein. The results show significant improvements:

### Before Fix
- Most walks terminated with "dead_end" status after only 2-3 steps
- Only 2-3 nodes typically received propagation weights
- Limited exploration of the network, even for viral proteins with known connections

### After Fix
- All walks now run to completion (max_score or max_steps)
- More nodes receive propagation weights (typically 4-8 nodes)
- Forced restarts are triggered when dead ends are encountered, allowing continued exploration
- Different parameter combinations produce different exploration patterns, as expected

### Example Results (DENV2 16681 NS3)

NS3 now shows connections to more host proteins, including:
- HSPH1 (Heat shock protein)
- CDC37 (Co-chaperone)
- HSP90AA1 (Heat shock protein)
- CETN2 (Centrin)
- LIG4 (DNA Ligase IV)
- OBI1 (Scaffold protein)
- Polymerase components (POLR2C, POLR3D)

These interactions reveal potentially important biological functions that would have been missed with the previous implementation.

## Comparison of Parameter Effects

The tests also revealed how different parameters affect the exploration:

1. **Restart Probability**:
   - Higher restart probability (0.3) tends to keep the walk closer to seed nodes
   - Lower restart probability (0.15) allows more distant exploration

2. **Max Steps**:
   - Larger max steps values allow more comprehensive exploration
   - This is particularly important for sparse networks like the test dataset

## Conclusion

The fix ensures that the random walk with restart algorithm properly explores the network, even when encountering dead ends. This is critical for identifying meaningful biological connections between viral proteins and host factors, particularly in sparse networks.

The improved algorithm now provides a more comprehensive view of the network neighborhood around each viral protein, which should lead to more reliable and biologically relevant hypotheses.
